# CartPole (DQN)
I have tried to train an agent using DQN (reinforcement learning) to solve the CartPole game in this directory. You can see the Python code [here](https://github.com/arashsajjadi/reinforcement-learning/blob/main/Projects/CartPole_DQN/RL1.ipynb).
Also, I have saved the trained model in this directory, which can access the trained agent without running the code.

My source is Nicholas Renotte's YouTube course.
