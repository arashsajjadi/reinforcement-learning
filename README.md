# reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is a part of machine learning that tries to do things to maximize the rewards of actions in a particular environment. Reinforcement learning algorithms aim to find the best action in a given environment. This type of machine learning can learn to perform the learning process and achieve its goals even in complex and uncertain environments. Just like the human brain, the system is rewarded for good choices and penalized for bad decisions, and it learns from each action.

## Study resources
My principal reference for studying reinforcement learning is the Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction [[1]](#1) book by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew Barto. I have also used the following courses to get started.

|   | Name of the course                    | Publisher's website | University or the instructor          | The number of parts |
