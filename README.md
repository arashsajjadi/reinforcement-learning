# reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is a part of machine learning that tries to do things to maximize the rewards of actions in a particular environment. Reinforcement learning algorithms aim to find the best action in a given environment. This type of machine learning can learn to perform the learning process and achieve its goals even in complex and uncertain environments. Just like the human brain, the system is rewarded for good choices and penalized for bad decisions, and it learns from each action.

## Study resources
My principal reference for studying reinforcement learning is the Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction [[1]](#1) book by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew Barto. I have also used the following courses to get started.

### Reinforcement Learning with Atari Pong

This repository contains a deep reinforcement learning project that trains an agent to play the classic game of Pong. The algorithm used is based on the "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" article by the DeepMind team of Google. The project is implemented using Pytorch, numpy, matplotlib and gym.

The agent starts off making random moves, but as it learns from its experiences, it becomes better at playing the game and scores more points. The training process is accompanied by a collection of videos of the agent playing the Pong game, which can be found in the [Pong Game Videos](https://github.com/arashsajjadi/Artificial-Neural-Network/tree/main/Final%20Project/PongVideos) directory.

If you're interested in learning more about the project or replicating the training process, check out the [Final Project](https://github.com/arashsajjadi/Artificial-Neural-Network/tree/main/Final%20Project) directory for the code and results. And you can find more detailed information about this project in the repository of [Artificial-Neural-Network](https://github.com/arashsajjadi/Artificial-Neural-Network)

This repository is just a part of the main project which is focused on reinforcement learning and it's a great starting point for anyone interested in learning about deep reinforcement learning with Atari Pong.
