# Reinforcement Learning Workshop

This repository contains the slides and resources for a workshop on Reinforcement Learning (RL) given by Arash Sajjadi at Shahid Beheshti University. The workshop was held on Workshop of Data Science, 2023.
Overview

## The workshop covered the following topics:

   - Fundamentals of RL
   - Tabular methods
   - Use of CNNs in RL
   - Hands-on demonstration of training an RL agent using the game Pong as an example

## Resources

In addition to the slides, the following resources were used in the workshop and can be used for further reading and understanding of the topic:

## Special Thanks


We would like to extend our special thanks to Prof. Hajiabolhassan for his guidance and expertise in teaching us about reinforcement learning. We would also like to thank the officials and presenters of the artificial neural networks course for their valuable insights and contributions to our understanding of the subject.

## Conclusion

We hope that this workshop provided a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, as well as a hands-on demonstration of how to train an RL agent using the game Pong as an example. We encourage you to continue exploring this exciting field of machine learning and to refer to the resources and further reading materials provided in the slides for deeper understanding.

Thank you for watching! We hope you found the workshop informative and valuable.
