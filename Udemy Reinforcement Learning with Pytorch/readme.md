# Udemy Reinforcement Learning with Pytorch

At the invitation of one of the capable professors of the [Data Science Center](https://ir.linkedin.com/company/sbu-data-science) in the Shahid Beheshti University, (Dr. [Haji Abolhassan](http://facultymembers.sbu.ac.ir/hhaji/)), I would like to give a short speech about the summary of what was said in this course. I will try to briefly convey to the students the main idea of solving the various reinforcement learning problems practically implemented in this course. Then, by explaining a concrete example from the last project done in this course, I will introduce them to the practical applications of reinforcement learning (Solving the game of pong using **computer vision** and **reinforcement learning** in an environment written in the **"gym"** library). 

As soon as the slides are ready, I will share the materials I prepare for this workshop on this page
