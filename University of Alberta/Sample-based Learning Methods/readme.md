# Sample-based Learning Methods


This course is the second of four courses in Augmented Learning at the University of Alberta. This course is divided into four weeks. At the end of each week, we must send exercises and quizzes related to the week's contents. I will post my answers on this page.

- First week:
  - Quiz: <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47760229/195380819-7138d259-8a3a-4d4b-98a0-3fd45c544653.png">Graded Quiz</a> $\rightarrow$ 83.33%
  - Assignment1: <a href="https://github.com/arashsajjadi/reinforcement-learning/blob/main/University%20of%20Alberta/Sample-based%20Learning%20Methods/Week1/Blackjack.ipynb">Blackjack</a> $\rightarrow$ This notebook is not graded. You do not need to write any answers.
- Second week:
